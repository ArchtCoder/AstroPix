# SwiftUI Project - Astronomy Picture of the Day API

Demonstrates a SwiftUI Astronomy Picture of the Day app, consuming NASA's APOD API for the last 7 days.

# APOD API

NASA provides a public API that allows us to request the current APOD, the APOD for a partucular date (or date range) or chose a number of random APOD images. 

You can view details of the API (and other NASA APIs) here: https://api.nasa.gov/index.html.
